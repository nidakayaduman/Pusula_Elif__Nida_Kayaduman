Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset related to drug side effects and preparing it for machine learning models. The project includes data exploration (EDA) and data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and standardizing numerical features.

How to Run the Code

Step 1: Download and Extract the Project
Download the Repository: Click on the green "Code" button on the GitHub page and select "Download ZIP". Extract the contents of the ZIP file to a folder on your computer.

Step 2: Install Required Libraries
Open a terminal in the project folder where the code is located and run the following commands to install the necessary Python libraries:

pip install pandas

pip install numpy

pip install matplotlib

pip install seaborn

pip install scikit-learn

This will install all the required libraries.

Step 3: Run the Jupyter Notebook

Open Jupyter Notebook and run the file. Execute each cell step-by-step to see the data analysis and preprocessing steps.
Make sure to update the file paths in the code according to your system.


Step 4: View the Processed Data

After running all the cells in the notebook, the processed dataset will be saved as a CSV file in the same folder. You can open this file with any spreadsheet software (like Excel) to view the cleaned and prepared data.

File Name: processed_side_effect_data.csv

Required Python Libraries

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

numpy: For numerical operations.

matplotlib: For data visualization.

seaborn: For statistical data visualization.

scikit-learn: For machine learning and data preprocessing.

Make sure to install these libraries before running the notebook.
